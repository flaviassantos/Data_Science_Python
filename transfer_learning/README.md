Transfer_Learning
==============================

This repository (and this [post](<https://flaviassantos.github.io/transfer-learning_/>)) shows how we can use transfer learning in keras with the example of training a 2 class classification model using Resnet-34 pre-trained weights. This is a CNN models trained on more than a million images of 1000 different categories.
